# Idea Hunt

Where anyone can post product ideas and developers can find their next build, inspired by r/sideproject and Hack Club.

## About
I'm currently working on developing this in Figma and exploring Airtable integration (since that's what Hack Club uses). The plan is to create a platform where:
1. Developers can post their ideas to gauge interest before building
2. Non-technical folks can find developers to collaborate with on their concepts
3. Ideas get visibility without requiring technical skills to present them

This was inspired by Hack Club's YSWS (You Ship We Ship) initiative. With IdeaHunt, Hack Club users can post project ideas while maintaining privacy. Only Hack Club members will see who's signed up for specific projects. This creates a more sustainable way to gauge interest in ideas while respecting privacy concerns.
